# PCA-from-scratch-using-Numpy
This is a code to perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) from scratch using Numpy to analyse which attributes are benefitical for predicting the output of  machine learning models.

It uses concept of eigen values and eigen vectors to analyse importance of an attribute. Other approach uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).

The attributes are also visualized to get better understanding of PCA working


The sample dataset used while making PCA is Iris dataset
