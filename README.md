# PCA-from-scratch-using-Numpy
This is a code to perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) from scratch using Numpy to analyze which attributes are beneficial for predicting the output of machine learning models.

It uses the concept of eigenvalues and eigenvectors to analyze the importance of an attribute. Another approach uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).

The attributes are also visualized to get a better understanding of PCA working

The sample dataset used while making PCA is Iris dataset
